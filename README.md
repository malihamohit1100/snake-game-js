<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a recreation of Snake, one of the most popular games that developers love to recreate. This solo project was developed in VSC using javascript as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!

The classic snake game involves a snake, represented as a square at first, which grows larger as it consumes food. Food items appear randomly on the board. I've also created a scoreboard to display the current and highest scores, which engages players further. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the board's edges, triggering a pop-up with instructions. Additionally, there is lively background music that enhances the gaming experience, along with sound effects for when the snake eats food and when it meets its end. See how big you can grow your snake!
