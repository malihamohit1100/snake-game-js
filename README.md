<h2>About the Snake-Game project </h2>
The classic snake game involves a snake, represented as a square at first, which grows larger as it consumes food. Food items appear randomly on the board. I've also created a scoreboard to display the current and highest scores, which engages players further. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the board's edges, triggering a pop-up with instructions. Additionally, there is lively background music that enhances the gaming experience, along with sound effects for when the snake eats food and when it meets its end.
